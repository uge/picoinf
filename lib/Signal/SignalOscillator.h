/*
 * Class designed to allow for the dynamic creation of a continuous signal.
 * Class implementation is designed for maximum speed.
 *   Uses integer-based approximations of non-integer values, so some error.
 * 
 * Main points:
 * - Calling code determines the signal source to use
 *   - eg sine wave, triangle, etc
 *   - each represents a repeating signal
 *     - not bounded to a specific timeframe
 *     - the intent is to stretch/squeeze this signal into whatever desired
 *       frequency
 *       - eg, produce a sine wave at 440Hz, where I sample 10,000 times/sec
 * 
 * - Calling code determines the sample rate (times/sec) it will ask for new
 *   samples from this class
 * 
 * - Calling code determines the frequency of the selected signal source
 * 
 * - Signal values are supported within a 256 value range.  Two modes:
 *   - Centered on 0 -- meaning both positive and negative: -128 to 127
 *   - Absolute      -- meaning positive values only:          0 to 255
 * 
 * Multiple SignalOscillators can be used in parallel.
 * - eg, multi instance, each configured for same sample rate
 * 
 * Binary Radians - brads
 * - steps around the signal are in a range of 0-255 (not degrees 0-360)
 * 
 * In multi-mode, phase shifts between can be configured for each.  eg:
 * - o1, 10kHz sine at 440Hz
 * - o2, 10kHz sine at 440Hz
 *   - o2 has *180 degree phase shift
 *     - notably, 180 degree must be converted to brad scale of 0-255
 * - provided each are sampled together, they'll stay in sync forever
 * 
 * 
 * Example use:
 * ------------
 * SignalOscillator o(SignalSourceSineWave::GetSample)
 * o.SetSampleRate(10000);  
 * o.SetFrequency(440);
 * while (1)
 * {
 *     uint8_t val = o.GetNextSampleAbs();
 *     // do something with it
 *     // sleep until next 100us marker
 * }
 * 
 * 
 * Other Notes
 * - Class original design was for audio synthesis.
 *   - So expected hundreds-to-thousands of Hz for signals
 * - Use cases where signals are meant to be multi-second need to consider
 *   implementation details
 *   - eg, stretching a sine wave over 5 seconds
 *   - the sine wave is 256 discrete points behind the scenes
 *   - sampling at 10,000 Hz is pointless
 *   - the most frequently you can get a different sample is period-in-secs/256
 *     - eg 1 second frequency = 1/256 = every  4 ms
 *     - eg 5 second frequency = 5/256 = every 19 ms
 *     - not bad, but worth avoiding extreme sampling in these cases
 * 
 * For maximum future compatibility, ignore implementation details.
 * Set whatever sampling frequency makes sense.
 *
